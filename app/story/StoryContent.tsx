              I helped shape the business model for Fooji, a multi-million dollar ad startup, by leveraging Vine's early days. We were interviewed by Robert Scoble. I find talent and trends early. I've worked in LA's music scene, sleeping on couches to support artists like Kevin George, and in New York's art world, learning from Andy Warhol's old friends. My photography has been featured in The Times, and I've designed for major artists and others.

              But it hasn't been easy. I faced a false arrest orchestrated by a former employer, Libbie Mugrabi, leading to a $5 million lawsuit (Daily Beast). My case, backed by a lawyer who's taken on dictators, will be a clean sweep. Currently, her second lawyer is trying to drop out of the court. I've also lost someone I loved to a heroin overdose, coming home from my arrest to find her.

              Currently, I'm building be-loved.app, a platform to modernize non-emergency medical transportation, aiming to replace outdated systems with tech-driven efficiency. I'm also envisioning Haven, a network state that combines AI-generated media, like netflix x spotify with aiâ€”with dark-styled accommodation living spaces as nice as Soho House, or Disney, and art an art gallery network like Gagosian. Haven would be a hive of 100,000 creators, producing billion-dollar films and music while living in resort-like compounds.

              I've de-escalated dangerous situations, like when I calmed an armed robbery with a college friend, and I've predicted trends early, like naming a high school business after Elon Musk in 2015. I'm passionate about freedom, ethics, and privacy, and I want to build a Network State.

              Ender's Game, is my favorite book. Ender was the best battle student, tricked into fighting a real war thinking it was a simulation, forced to be more ruthless than his natural state. Today, someone like Ender might know they're the best but be blocked by systems at every turn. I think in the many cases where an individual is the best in the world at something, they should be championed rather than nerfed.
